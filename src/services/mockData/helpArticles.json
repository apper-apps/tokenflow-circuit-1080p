Navigate to the API Keys section and create a new key with the appropriate permissions. The base URL for all API calls is https://api.tokenflow.pro/v1. All requests must include your API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. Here's a basic example of making your first API call using curl...",

    "content": "Token optimization is crucial for reducing API costs and improving performance. Here are the top strategies: 1. Use concise prompts - Remove unnecessary words and context. 2. Implement caching - Store responses for frequently asked questions. 3. Choose the right model - Use smaller models for simple tasks and larger models only when necessary. 4. Set appropriate max_tokens limits - This prevents unexpected large responses. 5. Batch similar requests when possible. These practices can reduce your token usage by 30-40%.",

    "content": "TokenFlow implements rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability. Free tier users have a limit of 1,000 requests per hour and 50,000 tokens per day. Pro tier users get 10,000 requests per hour and 500,000 tokens per day. Enterprise customers can request custom limits. When you hit a rate limit, you'll receive a 429 status code with details about when you can make your next request. Implement exponential backoff in your applications to handle rate limiting gracefully.",

Use a simple Map or more sophisticated solutions like Redis for distributed applications. Consider cache invalidation strategies - TTL-based expiration works well for most use cases. For user-specific content, implement per-user caching with appropriate security measures. Remember to cache both successful responses and handled errors to avoid repeated failed requests.",
